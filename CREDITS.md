# Credits and licences

Everything in this repository is either generated from the client's own logo
artwork, produced procedurally in code, or taken from a source with a licence
that permits this use. There are no stock photographs, and no third-party brand
logos.

## Imagery

Sites 1 and 3 carry no photographs at all; every visual in them is generated at
runtime or at build time. Site 2 carries the project photographs and renders
that came embedded in the client's own project sheets, and the renders from the
Madaniyat Hotel concept — see **Project photographs** below.

| Visual | Where | How it is made |
|---|---|---|
| Girih lattice background | Site 1, hero | Repeating SVG `<pattern>` written in `GirihPattern.tsx` — two squares and a circle per tile, ~700 bytes |
| Donut chart | Site 1, GDP structure | Recharts, from `content.json` |
| Regional salary bars | Site 1, human capital | Plain CSS bars, from `content.json` |
| Open Graph cards | All three | `scripts/process-logos.mjs`, composed as SVG and rasterised with sharp |
| Rotating globe | Site 2, prologue | three.js — a generated lat/long wireframe, a marker over Tashkent and great-circle arcs. No texture, no model |
| Arc fallback | Site 2, prologue | Inline SVG ellipses, shown when WebGL is unavailable or motion is reduced |
| Silk Road corridor | Site 2, chapter I | A hand-authored schematic SVG path. Diagrammatic, not a map — it makes no territorial claim |
| Project beeswarm | Site 2, chapter IV | Inline SVG, one dot per project on a logarithmic investment axis, packed in code from `forum-2026.json` |
| Thematic direction icons | Site 2, chapter III | Eight glyphs drawn by hand on one 24-unit grid in `ThemeIcon.vue` |
| Film grain | Site 2, the two lit stages | An inline `feTurbulence` SVG data URI at 3.5% opacity |
| Region choropleth | Site 3, map | d3-geo, over the boundary data below |
| Locator map | Site 2, contacts | OpenStreetMap's own embed — no key, no account; see below |

## Project photographs

The images on site 2's project cards are the client's own: they came embedded in
the `.pptx` sheets the organiser supplied, and `scripts/build-project-photos.mjs`
pulls them out, matched to the slide they belong to. The Madaniyat Hotel's
renders come from its concept PDF in the same way.

Nothing is sourced from anywhere else. Two classes of image are **deliberately
dropped**:

- **Screenshots of online maps.** Several sheets illustrate their location with a
  grab of a mapping service. Those are not the client's to republish, so they are
  detected and discarded — a map tile has a large area of flat near-neutral paper
  and almost no texture, which a photograph does not.
- **Template furniture.** The forum lockup, the masthead rule and the section
  icons repeat on every slide of a deck, so anything appearing on more than two
  slides is dropped.

Some of what remains is a site plan or an annotated satellite collage that the
client assembled themselves. Those are published as supplied; if any of them
turns out not to be the client's own, it should be removed.

## Map data

The locator map in site 2's contacts block is **OpenStreetMap**'s standard embed
— no API key and no account. Map data is © OpenStreetMap contributors, available
under the Open Database Licence; the credit is printed under the map. The
address was resolved to coordinates through OSM's Nominatim rather than guessed.

## Geographic data

**geoBoundaries** — Open Administrative Boundaries, gbOpen release.

- Dataset: Uzbekistan ADM1 (2017), 14 first-order administrative divisions
- Licence: **Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) 1.0**
- Source URL: `https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries` (release `9469f09`)
- Upstream source: `wambachers-osm.website/boundaries/`
- Citation: Runfola, D. et al. (2020) *geoBoundaries: A global database of political
  administrative boundaries.* PLoS ONE 15(4): e0231866.

Processing (`scripts/build-geo.mjs`): properties reduced to the region `id` used
in `content.json`, rings simplified with Douglas–Peucker and rounded to four
decimals, and rewound to the orientation d3-geo expects. 6 206 positions → 2 733;
170 KB → 49 KB. The ODbL requires that this derived database stay under the same
licence, which it does; the attribution appears in the site 3 footer.

## Typefaces

All self-hosted through [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org); nothing is fetched
from a third-party CDN at runtime.

| Family | Licence | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Inter | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Site 1 — body |
| Manrope | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Site 1 — headings |
| Fraunces | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Site 2 — headings |
| Space Grotesk | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Site 2 — body |
| IBM Plex Sans | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Site 3 — interface |
| IBM Plex Mono | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Site 3 — figures |

Note on site 3: IBM Plex places the Uzbek apostrophes `ʻ` (U+02BB) and `ʼ`
(U+02BC) on a 0.6em advance, which splits every word containing one. A
`@font-face` claiming only those two codepoints borrows them from a system UI
font; see the comment at the top of `site-3-explorer/src/styles/app.css`.

## Icons

- **Lucide** (site 1) — ISC licence. Fifteen icons are imported by name through
  `ContentIcon.tsx`; the namespace import that would pull in the whole set is
  deliberately avoided.
- Sites 2 and 3 use no icon package. Site 2 draws its few marks as inline SVG;
  site 3 uses single typographic glyphs.

## Logo artwork

`logo/` contains the client's own artwork and is **never modified** — it is
opened read-only and every derived asset is written to `brand/`. Provenance,
extraction method and the colours measured from it are documented in
`brand/LOGO_INVENTORY.md`.

The State Emblem of the Republic of Uzbekistan appears in two of the supplied
families. It is **not extracted from the agency artwork** (`logo/invest Uzb 2.*`):
those pages are a concept rendering and must not carry state insignia.

The emblem is also part of the Tourism Investment Forum lockup the organiser
issued (`brand/newlogo/`). **Site 2 uses that lockup in full**, on the client's
written instruction of 2026-10-07: the page is to become the forum's official
site, and the lockup with the emblem is the mark the organiser issued for it. It
appears in the header, the title card and the footer, and the emblem alone is the
site's icon.

`brand/svg/forum-wordmark.svg` remains as the emblem-free reduction, for any slot
where the emblem would be too small to survive.

The concept/demo disclaimer in the footer is **still switched on**. The client
authorised the emblem, not the removal of the disclaimer; that is a separate
decision and `meta.disclaimer_enabled` in `shared/data/content.json` is the single
switch for it.

## Third-party organisations

Names of organisations that took part in TIIF 2026 appear as **text only**, from
`content.json`. No third-party logos, wordmarks or brand colours are used.

## Client source material

The Tourism Investment Forum content on site 2 comes from documents supplied by
the organiser for this project: the forum concept, the preliminary programme, and
three batches of investment project sheets (`onepager .zip`, `Лойиҳалар new.zip`,
`Лойиҳалар.zip`). They are read by `scripts/build-forum-data.mjs` and are **not
redistributed** — the originals stay out of the repository and only the parsed
facts are published.

The sheets arrive in three generations of the same template with different field
lists, and the same project appears in more than one batch. The newest sheet for
a project wins; every sheet it was found in is recorded on the record, so a
figure can be traced back.

The project sheets contain an `INVESTMENT CONTACT` block with an initiator's name
and personal mobile number, and the raw Tashkent-region tables add taxpayer
identification numbers and bank details. **None of it is carried into
`forum-2026.json` or onto the page** — the contact block is parsed in order to be
discarded.

## Data sources

Every figure on all three sites comes from `shared/data/content.json`, and each
one carries a source id resolved to a title, URL and access date in the footer of
each site. The full list is in `docs/SOURCES.md`.

Live exchange rates come from the Central Bank of Uzbekistan's public JSON feed
(`cbu.uz`). `invest.gov.uz` is linked to, never scraped.

## Software

Frameworks and libraries are listed in each site's `package.json`. The notable
ones — React, Vue, Svelte, Vite, Tailwind CSS, GSAP (standard licence, free for
this use), three.js, D3, Recharts, Lenis, Framer Motion, sharp, svgo, mupdf — are
MIT-licensed except where noted.
